            <b>Bluetooth controlled Home-made Automation System:</b>
            <p>This project has a bluetooth that accepts the instruction from the user and does the work.Based on bluetooth module and developed in LtSpice.</p>

            <b>Mobile Phone Detector Circuit</b>
            <p>A circuit based on Op-Amp that detects the mobile phone,
                when a signal is sent using the mobile phone. This circuit is
                developed in Proteus. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Automation Car Headlight Dimmer</b>
            <p>The circuit detects the lights from nearby vehicles and turns
                the high beams off to avoid dazzling those drivers. The circuit is
                based on LDR, transistor and developed in LtSpice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>People Counter:</b>
            <p>The circuit detects number of people passed across it. This is based on flipflops.</p>
